## Inserting and Replacing Records

```SQL
INSERT INTO people (first_name, last_name, birthday, home_id)
	VALUES
	('John', 'Smith', '1998-04-07', 4),
	('Maya', 'Wasserman' , NULL, 4),
	('Paul', 'Thompson', '1996-05-27', 1);
```

#### Replace

```SQL
DELETE FROM people WHERE first_name='Maya';
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM people;
```

```SQL
MERGE INTO people (first_name, last_name, birthday, home_id)
	VALUES
	('John', 'Sharma', '1998-04-07', 1),
	('Paul', 'Sharma', '1996-05-27', 4),
	('Maya', 'Wasserman', '1900-01-05',1);
```


## JOIN

```SQL
INSERT INTO people (first_name, last_name, birthday)
	VALUES ('Eli', 'Kramer', '1984-01-15');
```
	
	
```SQL
SELECT * FROM people;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM home;
```

```SQL
SELECT p.first_name, h.address 
FROM PEOPLE p
INNER JOIN HOME h  on (p.HOME_ID = h.ID)
```

```SQL
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM PEOPLE p
INNER JOIN HOME h  on (p.HOME_ID = h.HOME_ID)
WHERE p.HOME_ID = 1
```

```SQL
SELECT p.*, h.address, h.homenumber
FROM PEOPLE p
INNER JOIN HOME h  on (p.HOME_ID = h.HOME_ID)
WHERE p.first_name  LIKE '%e%'
```

##### Exercise:

Devise a report
	show all the people in your address table
	only if you know their birthday
	show name, address and birthday
	order by month, so January birthdays are first

Devise a report
	Output all information for all people and their home information


	
## UNION

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Notice that each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns. The columns must also have similar data types. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order.

SELECT _column\_name(s)_ FROM table1
	UNION
SELECT _column\_name(s)_ FROM table2;

Note: The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use the ALL keyword with UNION.

SELECT _column\_name(s)_ FROM table1
	UNION ALL
SELECT _column\_name(s)_ FROM table2;

##### Example

```SQL
SELECT HOME_ID FROM People
UNION
SELECT HOME_ID FROM Home
ORDER 	BY HOME_ID; 
```

```SQL
SELECT HOME_ID FROM People
UNION ALL
SELECT HOME_ID FROM Home
ORDER 	BY HOME_ID; 
```
